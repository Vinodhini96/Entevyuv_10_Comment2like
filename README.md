# Video likes Prediction based on Comments Project

This project aims to predict the number of Likes a video gets based on the Comments of the video using machine learning models. It involves several steps including data cleaning, preprocessing, vectorization, and model comparison.

## Overview

- The dataset used in this project contains comments along with various features such as the number of comments, views, and comment likes.
- The data cleaning step ensures the data is free from missing values and duplicates.
- Preprocessing includes removing regular expressions, stop words, and applying lemmatization techniques.
- Vectorization converts the preprocessed text data into a numerical representation using the CountVectorizer.
- The Random Forest model is trained and compared with other models using evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R2 score.
- Random Forest is selected as the final model due to its superior performance.
